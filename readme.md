# John Kroll Web Portfolio

### Overview
Hello!  My name is John Kroll and I am a Web Developer, although I love to get my hands dirty with software development. I know there is always more to learn which is why I like to try out newer and upcoming technologies.  This field is ever changing so there is no reason to try something different.
